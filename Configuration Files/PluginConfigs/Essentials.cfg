  <Motd>WELCOME TO GUARDIANS VANILLA PLUS

!!!PUT A BEACON ON YOUR GRID!!!

ALL PLAYERS must join the discord server and comment "acknowledged" in Rules-Confirmation channel after reading this MOTD. https://discord.gg/HJQKNzU. Please set your Discord nickname to match your in-game name.
***WORLD DETAILS***
New setup for November 2020 with Nexus Server link, Galados V start planet, and Bylen gas giant with asteroid rings, WeaponCore, and Faction Territories and 3 new moons including Pertam!
New players start on Galados V, and must make their way to space and Bylen's Ring and moons
Resource scarcity has been tuned to encourage encounters and PVP.
Platinum, Uranium, and Stalinium ore can ONLY be found on moons
Magnesium can be found ONLY on Galados V
Procedural asteroids are ONLY in Bylen's Ring.
Bylen is a gas giant with high gravity, so its atmosphere will destroy you and your grids.
NPC space port coming soon
Jump Drive Disruptor turret, and Radar block, and Stalinium Solar panels are built using Stalinium.
All voxels reset once a month on the 1st or as-needed, so beware building inside planet or asteroid voxels.
Info on all mods is in Discord mod info channel.
Server restarts every 6 hours; 6/12/6/12, EST time zone.
All info in Discord.

***SAFEZONE INFORMATION***
Automatic Faction Safezone for ALL faction large station grids over 30 blocks. 
Must be in a faction to receive FSZ features.
FSZs only enable 30 seconds after the last faction member has logged off, and disable for all grids when the first member logs back on.
FSZs will not activate on grids with neutral or enemy grids nearby!
See commands below
Player safezone generators only are in-voxel only (connected to planet or asteroid)
Safezone chips are buildable (look under Tools category in assemblers).

***LOGOFF INFORMATION***
All large grids convert to station on last faction member logout (including restarts).
All Program Blocks (PBs), and spotlights turn off on last faction member logout.
Grids that are too close to voxel (2.5m) may not convert to ship again. Use drills to add clearance from voxels.
Players must maintain their Active status by logging in at least every 14 days.
Inactive player grids will be auto-stored in the Quantum Hangar Plugin after 14 days (see commands to retrieve stored grids).

***CLEANUP INFORMATION***
YOU NEED A BEACON on all grids! 
Respawn ships auto-delete on logoff regardless of beacon. 
Beacons have reduced part cost and can be turned off.
Any grid without a beacon will delete every 1.5hrs during cleanup.
Unpowered grids with unassembled beacons will delete. Build the beacon fully.
Grids are backed up via Grid Backup plugin for extreme emergencies. Each is handled case-by-case. Grids deleted due to cleanup will not be replaced.

***COMMANDS***
/pasteconvert - Converts a faction owned station to ship.
/rename newgridname - Renames a grid that your faction owns
/Ownership - Tells you the owner of the grid in front of you. Useful for seeing who owns a safezone...
!grids list - Gives you a list of all of YOUR owned grids and the GPS. Useful for finding lost grids.
!Motd - To re-open this MOTD. Or use the med bay screen :P
!entities refresh - Fixes desynced and bugged grids, usually. If it does not, try:
/Unfuckit - If relogging and other measures do not fix a bugged grid, this usually will. Look at the grid so your chest faces it, type the command, follow the prompt. Fixes most bugs.
/forceremovezone - removes faction safezones if they get bugged and stuck on. Unlikely.
!blocklimit mylimit - lists player's limits.
!blocklimit limits - List the current limit settings for the server.
!advice - Opens Dialog window with gameplay advice.
Shift + R - Place faction visible GPS waypoint (does not work well on planet surface). 
!hangar load [Name or ID number] - Attempts to load specified grid

!!!PUT A BEACON ON YOUR GRID!!!

ALL PLAYERS must join the discord server and comment "acknowledged" in Rules-Confirmation channel after reading this MOTD. https://discord.gg/HJQKNzU. Please set your Discord nickname to match your in-game name.
***WORLD DETAILS***
New setup for November 2020 with Nexus Server link, Galados V start planet, and Bylen gas giant with asteroid rings, WeaponCore, and Faction Territories and 3 new moons including Pertam!
New players start on Galados V, and must make their way to space and Bylen's Ring and moons
Resource scarcity has been tuned to encourage encounters and PVP.
Platinum, Uranium, and Stalinium ore can ONLY be found on moons
Magnesium can be found ONLY on Galados V
Procedural asteroids are ONLY in Bylen's Ring.
Bylen is a gas giant with high gravity, so its atmosphere will destroy you and your grids.
NPC space port coming soon
Jump Drive Disruptor turret, and Radar block, and Stalinium Solar panels are built using Stalinium.
All voxels reset once a month on the 1st or as-needed, so beware building inside planet or asteroid voxels.
Info on all mods is in Discord mod info channel.
Server restarts every 6 hours; 6/12/6/12, EST time zone.
All info in Discord.

***SAFEZONE INFORMATION***
Automatic Faction Safezone for ALL faction large station grids over 30 blocks. 
Must be in a faction to receive FSZ features.
FSZs only enable 30 seconds after the last faction member has logged off, and disable for all grids when the first member logs back on.
FSZs will not activate on grids with neutral or enemy grids nearby!
See commands below
Player safezone generators only are in-voxel only (connected to planet or asteroid)
Safezone chips are buildable (look under Tools category in assemblers).

***LOGOFF INFORMATION***
All large grids convert to station on last faction member logout (including restarts).
All Program Blocks (PBs), and spotlights turn off on last faction member logout.
Grids that are too close to voxel (2.5m) may not convert to ship again. Use drills to add clearance from voxels.
Players must maintain their Active status by logging in at least every 14 days.
Inactive player grids will be auto-stored in the Quantum Hangar Plugin after 14 days (see commands to retrieve stored grids).

***CLEANUP INFORMATION***
YOU NEED A BEACON on all grids! 
Respawn ships auto-delete on logoff regardless of beacon. 
Beacons have reduced part cost and can be turned off.
Any grid without a beacon will delete every 1.5hrs during cleanup.
Unpowered grids with unassembled beacons will delete. Build the beacon fully.
Grids are backed up via Grid Backup plugin for extreme emergencies. Each is handled case-by-case. Grids deleted due to cleanup will not be replaced.

***COMMANDS***
/pasteconvert - Converts a faction owned station to ship.
/rename newgridname - Renames a grid that your faction owns
/Ownership - Tells you the owner of the grid in front of you. Useful for seeing who owns a safezone...
!grids list - Gives you a list of all of YOUR owned grids and the GPS. Useful for finding lost grids.
!Motd - To re-open this MOTD. Or use the med bay screen :P
!entities refresh - Fixes desynced and bugged grids, usually. If it does not, try:
/Unfuckit - If relogging and other measures do not fix a bugged grid, this usually will. Look at the grid so your chest faces it, type the command, follow the prompt. Fixes most bugs.
/forceremovezone - removes faction safezones if they get bugged and stuck on. Unlikely.
!blocklimit mylimit - lists player's limits.
!blocklimit limits - List the current limit settings for the server.
!advice - Opens Dialog window with gameplay advice.
Shift + R - Place faction visible GPS waypoint (does not work well on planet surface). 
!hangar load [Name or ID number] - Attempts to load specified grid
!hangar list - Lists all active ships and their pcu values that are in your hangar
!hangar info [Name or ID number] - Provides info about the grid in your hangar
/sort - While sitting in seat will run the sorting mod manually on all connected grids
/rewardhelp - returns a list of chat commands for the user
/rename “Grid Name” - change the name of the grid if owned by other faction member
/convert - converts the grid into either ship or station, more forgiving than using terminal
!nexus lobby - Returns players to the nexus lobby sector
